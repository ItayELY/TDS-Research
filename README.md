**On Demand Detections and Explanations of Correlation Pattern Bias in EDA Workflows**

**Overview**
This repository contains the implementation of a novel approach to enhancing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature selection processes within the Data Science pipeline. 
The focus is on addressing the pervasive issue of correlation bias, particularly Simpson’s Paradox, through automated detection and explanation of such occurrences within datasets.

**Features**
* Python implementation of the algorithm for automated detection and explanation of correlation bias (Simpson’s Paradox) within datasets.
* Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the application of the algorithm on sample datasets.

**Datasets**
This repository includes three real-world datasets:
1. Iris species dataset: A set of 150 records under 5 attributes - Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal Width, and Class (Species).
2. Penguins dataset: Observations of penguin species including measurements like bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass, aiding in ecological research and species identification.
3. Auto-mpg dataset: Information about various car models, including attributes like miles per gallon (mpg), cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, and origin.
